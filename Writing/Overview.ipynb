    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This github contains the code use for analysis conducted at Baycrest research Hosptial under the guidance of [Dr.Zhongxu Liu](http://psych.utoronto.ca/Neuropsychologylab/zhongxu.html) . Most of the code, if not adapted from Dr.Liu's source material are written based on his direct direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in Python, Matlab and bash language. Throughout the project it is assumed that the subject's data is in the same folder as The script folder. Such that from the main project directory, Data/Raw_data finds the raw data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code relies heavily on : \n",
    "\n",
    "* [SPM Toolbox](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) \n",
    "* [Conn Toolbox](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn)\n",
    "* [Freesurefer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals: \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to perform functional connectitivty analysis on the Oculomotor and memory system. The data used is the same as that of Dr.Liu's phd projct (link) . No data available on this repo due to obvious ethical cocerns. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps \n",
    "\n",
    "### 0. [Setup](../Code/0. Setup)\n",
    "\n",
    "[0.1](../Code/0. Setup/StructCreating.m) Renaming Folders : The folder names produced based on the trial and block order were changed to reflect the name of the condition as shown below . A structure called mysubject was created to retain the name changes and be used later for analysis."
